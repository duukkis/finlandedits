Finnish government edits, a twitter bot.

* https://twitter.com/FinlandEdits
* Base code from https://github.com/edsu/anon
* Data from Wikipedia edits
* IP-addresses are in [config.json](config.json)

At the end of config.json there is 5 different ip's that I could not resolve, which agencies they are, but they have made some edits, so I included them also.

THE IP-ADDRESSES COULD BE WRONG. THEY ARE PICKED FROM Wikipedia edit-lists. And referenced with whois data. They are educated guesses. I have validated ip-address with two different ways.

1. whois ip > descr: Valtiokonttori/VIP/Agency name
2. See edits from a ip-address: https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toiminnot:Muokkaukset/46.30.132.227
